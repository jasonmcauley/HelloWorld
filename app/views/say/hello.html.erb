<p>Hello, World!</p>

<p>
  This is the time:  <%= @time %>
  <br /><br />
  Say <a href="/say/goodbye">goodbye</a>
  <br /><br />
  Or <%= link_to("goodbye", say_goodbye_path) %>
  <br /> <br />
  
  <!-- This file name thing could be useful for pulling back a list of
  images or something from a directory, keep it in mind I guess -->
  <%for file in @files%>
    file name is: <%= file %>
    <br />
  <% end %>
    <br /><br />
    I wanted to add this new text to my branch but won't be in the master.
